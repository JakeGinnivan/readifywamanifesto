# readifywamanifesto

This repo was created as a joint workspace for the WA Team to collaborate and form a v0.1 of their new working manifesto. This should be a 

> set of guiding principles around what we stand for in this state so that when we make decisions we have a set of principles to help us qualify that decision quickly. 

Github seems to make sense since we should all know how to collaborate using this medium. [Feel free to object](https://github.com/cottsak/readifywamanifesto/issues) tho! ;-)

If you agree and subscribe to this idea please start a discussion using an [Issue](https://github.com/cottsak/readifywamanifesto/issues) and then if appropriate create a Pull Request against the template.

If you think this is not the right idea, please also make your voice known by raising an [Issue](https://github.com/cottsak/readifywamanifesto/issues).

The actual manifesto document is [manifesto.md](https://github.com/cottsak/readifywamanifesto/blob/master/manifesto.md) and is entirely up for grabs. I've made an initial start to it and set an example template. It seems to make sense that the form is simple and concise and I feel that concrete examples will add value to bullet-point style statements, if that's what we go with. I also love how the [Agile Manifesto is signed](http://agilemanifesto.org/) by those who contributed to it. Please continue my theme and add your name if you like this idea and/or subscribe to this whole concept in general. How cool would it be if Readify eventually formed a company-wide one of these for consulting and everyone signed it? 

Anyway.. enough ado. Go and open an [Issue](https://github.com/cottsak/readifywamanifesto/issues)!
