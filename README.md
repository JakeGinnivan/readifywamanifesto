# readifywamanifesto

This repo was created as a joint workspace for the WA Team to collaborate and form a v0.1 of their new working manifesto. This should be a "set of guiding principles around what we stand for in this state so that when we make decisions we have a set of principles to help us qualify that decision quickly". Github seems to make sense since we should all know how to colaborate using this medium. [Feel free to object](https://github.com/cottsak/readifywamanifesto/issues) tho! ;-)
